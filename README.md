=============

To get this to work please clone the grails cxf test project and start that up before running this project.

```console
git clone https://github.com/ctoestreich/grails-cxf-test.git
cd grails-cxf-test
grails run-app
``

```console
git clone https://github.com/ctoestreich/cxf-mono-test.git

Run the TestService class and you should see something like

```console

2 :: 1 Binder?! I hardly know her!
Colombia = Yummy
Ethiopia = Drink
```
